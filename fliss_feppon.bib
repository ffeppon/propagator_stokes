  abstract = {We study the propagation of elastic waves in the time-harmonic regime in a waveguide which is unbounded in one direction and bounded in the two other (transverse) directions. We assume that the waveguide is thin in one of these transverse directions, which leads us to consider a Kirchhoff-Love plate model in a locally perturbed 2D strip. For time harmonic scattering problems in unbounded domains, well-posedness does not hold in a classical setting and it is necessary to prescribe the behaviour of the solution at infinity. This is challenging for the model that we consider and constitutes our main contribution. Two types of boundary conditions are considered: either the strip is simply supported or the strip is clamped. The two boundary conditions are treated with two different methods. For the simply supported problem, the analysis is based on a result of Hilbert basis in the transverse section. For the clamped problem, this property does not hold. Instead we adopt the Kondratiev's approach, based on the use of the Fourier transform in the unbounded direction, together with techniques of weighted Sobolev spaces with detached asymptotics. After introducing radiation conditions, the corresponding scattering problems are shown to be well-posed in the Fredholm sense. We also show that the solutions are the physical (outgoing) solutions in the sense of the limiting absorption principle.},

The governing equations for the periodically developed heat transfer regime in isothermal solids are derived. It is shown that the appropriate macro-scale temperature in the periodically developed heat transfer regime is obtained by averaging the temperature with a specific weighting function which is adapted to the temperature decay rate. This matched weighting function allows the representation of the macro-scale interfacial heat transfer and thermal dispersion source by means of a spatially constant interfacial heat transfer coefficient and thermal dispersion vector, which both can be calculated from the periodic rescaled temperature on a unit cell of the solid structures. Moreover, it is proved that for small temperature decay rates, the matched weighting function yields the same macro-scale description as repeated volume averaging. The theoretical framework of this paper is applied to a case study, describing the heat transfer between a fluid and an array of solid cylinders at constant temperature.},

  abstract = {This work treats the macro-scale description of flow and heat transfer in systems with spatially periodic solid structures, like compact heat exchangers and heat sinks with fin arrays or tube bundles. The presented macro-scale description allows us to extract the physically meaningful overall characteristics of the very detailed flow velocity, pressure and temperature fields in a heat transfer device. In that regard, it enables data reduction for the huge amount of detailed information which results after direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes flow and temperature equations for the device. The presented macro-scale description also allows us to determine the macro-scale characteristics of the flow and temperature fields in the laminar periodically developed regime by solving a simple closure model on a unit cell of the solid structures. As the closure model for the flow and heat transfer within the unit cell is in exact agreement with DNS results for the entire array of solid structures, model reduction is achieved in a consistent manner with respect to DNS. The model equations for the macro-scale flow and heat transfer are obtained by weighted spatial averaging, or filtering, of the Navier-Stokes equations. It is shown that the macro-scale flow velocity and macro-scale pressure in the periodically developed flow regime must be defined through a double volume-average filter to ensure that the macro-scale flow velocity and macro-scale pressure gradient are spatially constant. In that case, also the interfacial force and the momentum dispersion source, which appear in the macro-scale flow equations, are spatially constant, so that they can be easily governed from the developed flow equations on a unit cell. Furthermore, it is shown that the macro-scale temperature in the periodically developed heat transfer regime in isothermal solid structures is best defined through a filter that is matched to the temperature decay rate. With the matched filter, the macro-scale fluid temperature varies exponentially in the main flow direction and plays a role similar to that of the bulk temperature in developed duct flow. The matched filter also ensures that the macro-scale interfacial heat transfer between the flow and the solid structures can be represented by a spatially constant heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the matched filter defines a spatially constant thermal dispersion coefficient to represent the thermal dispersion source in the macro-scale temperature equation. Both coefficients are easily governed from the rescaled temperature on a unit cell. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the appropriate definition of the macro-scale temperature in the periodically developed conjugate heat transfer regime again requires a double volume-average filter. The double volume-average filter yields a linearly changing macro-scale temperature and a constant macro-scale interfacial heat flux in the periodically developed conjugate heat transfer regime. Moreover, with the double volume average, the thermal dispersion source, the thermal tortuosity and the interfacial heat transfer coefficient all become spatially constant, so that they are easily governed from the periodic temperature part on a unit cell.},

  abstract = {We present a macro-scale description of quasi-periodically developed flow in channels, which relies on double volume-averaging. We show that quasi-developed macro-scale flow is characterized by velocity modes which decay exponentially in the main flow direction. We prove that the closure force can be represented by an exact permeability tensor consisting of two parts. The first part, which is due to the developed macro-scale flow, is uniform everywhere, except in the side-wall region, where it is affected by the macro-scale velocity profile and its slip length. The second part expresses the resistance against the velocity mode, so it decays exponentially as the flow develops. It satisfies a specific closure problem on a transversal row of the array. From these properties, we assess the validity of the classical closure problem for the volume-averaged flow equations. We show that all its underlying assumptions are partly violated by an exponentially vanishing error during flow development. Furthermore, we show that it modifies the eigenvalues, modes, and onset point of quasi-developed flow, when it is applied to reconstruct the macro-scale flow. The former theoretical aspects are illustrated for high-aspect-ratio channels with high-porosity arrays of equidistant in-line square cylinders, by means of direct numerical simulation and explicit filtering of the flow. In particular, we present extensive solutions of the classical closure problem for Reynolds numbers up to 600, porosities between 0.2 and 0.95, and flow directions between 0 and 45 degrees, though the channel height has been kept equal to the cylinder spacing. These closure solutions are compared with the actual closure force in channels with cylinder arrays of a porosity between 0.75 and 0.94, for Reynolds numbers up to 300.},

As the amplitudes of these modes exhibit streamwise periodicity, they can be determined on a single transversal row of the array. Their shape and corresponding decay rate are governed by an eigenvalue problem which generalizes the Orr-Sommerfeld equation for quasi-developed Poiseuille flow. By means of full-scale channel flow simulations, we numerically investigate the onset point, extent, eigenvalues and perturbation sizes of quasi-periodically developed flow in channels with equidistant in-line square cylinders, assuming a parabolic inlet velocity profile. In particular, the dependence on the mass flow rate, the aspect ratio and height of the channel is discussed, considering three porosities of the cylinder array (0.75, 0.89 and 0.94), and Reynolds numbers from 20 to 300, based on a reference length of twice the channel height. It is observed that the region of quasiperiodically developed flow covers a large part of the region of flow development in the channel. Therefore, the corresponding eigenvalues explain largely the observed scaling laws for the onset point of periodically developed flow.},

In optics, such defects are created to construct an (open) waveguide that concentrates light. The existence and the computation of the eigenmodes is a crucial issue. This is related to a self-adjoint eigenvalue problem associated to a PDE in an unbounded domain (in the directions orthogonal to the line defect), which makes both the analysis and the computations more complex. Using a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) approach, we show that this problem is equivalent to one set on a small neighborhood of the defect. On contrary to existing methods, this one is exact but there is a price to be paid : the reduction of the problem leads to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem of a fixed point nature.},

This ensures uniqueness - except for a countable set of frequencies which correspond to the resonances- and yields existence when one is able to apply Fredholm alternative. This solution is called the outgoing solution. However, such radiation conditions are difficult to handle numerically. In this paper, we propose so-called transparent boundary conditions which enables us to characterize the outgoing solution. Moreover, the problem set in a bounded domain containing the junction with this transparent boundary conditions is of Fredholm type. These transparent boundary conditions are based on Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators whose construction is described in the paper. On contrary to the other approaches, the advantage of this approach is that a numerical method can be naturally derived in order to compute the outgoing solution. Numerical results illustrate and validate the method.},

This methodology is evaluated as a means to reduce the computational cost of optimization, compared to optimization based on direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Navier--Stokes equations, and also to provide a clear interpretation to intermediate (gray) material during optimization. Macro-scale topology optimization is applied to minimize the power dissipation in a pipe bend and a diffuser design, for which the optimized size distribution of an array of solid microstructures is determined. Afterwards, the methodology is validated by thoroughly comparing multiple designs appearing throughout the macro-scale optimization process to equivalent design topologies analyzed using DNS. From this comparison, the macro-scale equations are observed to qualitatively capture the overall flow patterns in various design topologies. Also, the macro-scale equations can adequately predict general optimization trends relating to design changes made during the optimization process. However, large quantitative discrepancies remain between the macro-scale and DNS, making the former a rather poor indicator of the precise value of the power dissipation, for a given design topology.},

Neumann's boundarycondition is imposed on the lateral boundary of the cylinder and Dirichlet condition on its base. Under the assumption that the coefficients stabilize to a periodic regime, we prove the existence of a bounded solution, its stabilization to a constant, and provide necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness.},

  abstract = {The concepts of fully developed flow and heat transfer have been generalized to accommodate ducts whose cross-sectional area varies periodically in the streamwise direction. The identification of the periodicity characteristics of the velocity components and of a reduced pressure function enables the flow field analysis to be confined to a single isolated module, without involvement with the entrance region problem. A similar modular analysis can be made for the temperature field, but the periodicity conditions are of a different nature depending on the thermal boundary conditions. For uniform wall temperature, profiles of similar shape recur periodically. On the other band, for prescribed wall heat flux which is the same for all modules, the temperature field itself is periodic provided that a linear term related to the bulk temperature change is subtracted. The concepts and solution procedure for the periodic fully developed regime were applied to a heat exchanger configuration consisting of successive ranks of isothermal plate segments placed transverse to the mainflow direction. The computed laminar flow field was found to be characterized by strong blockage effects and massive recirculation zones. The fully developed Nusselt numbers are much higher than those for conventional laminar duct flows and show a marked dependence on the Reynolds number.},

The existence of solutions with arbitrary flux in a general channel supplemented with slip boundary conditions, which tend to the associated shear flows at far fields, is established. Furthermore, if the flux is suitably small, the solution is proved to be unique. One of the crucial ingredients is to construct an appropriate flux carrier and to show a Hardy type inequality for flows with full slip boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {We investigate to what degree the steady laminar flow in typical micro- and mini-channels with offset strip fin arrays can be described as developed on a macro-scale level, in the presence of channel entrance and sidewall effects. Hereto, the extent of the developed and quasi-developed flow regions in such channels is determined through large-scale numerical flow simulations. It is observed that the onset point of developed flow increases linearly with the Reynolds number and channel width but remains small relative to the total channel length. Furthermore, we find that the local macro-scale pressure gradient and closure force for the (double) volume-averaged Navier--Stokes equations are adequately modeled by a developed friction factor correlation, as typical discrepancies are below 15\% in both the developed and developing flow region. We show that these findings can be attributed to the eigenvalues and mode amplitudes, which characterize the quasi-developed flow in the entrance region of the channel. Finally, we discuss the influence of the channel side walls on the flow periodicity, the mass flow rate, as well as the macro-scale velocity profile, which we capture by a displacement factor and slip length coefficient. Our findings are supported by extensive numerical data for fin height-to-length ratios up to 1, fin pitch-to-length ratios up to 0.5, and channel aspect ratios between 1/5 and 1/17, covering Reynolds numbers from 28 to 1224.},
